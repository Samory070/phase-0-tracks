*In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A chunk of data on a server that acts as its own entity running it's own operating system to be ued to host websites. With root access, you have complete control over the server environment to install custom programs or open ports. There are cost saving versus using a dedicated server hosting
