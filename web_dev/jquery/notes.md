*What sorts of resources will help? 
Videos, jQuery docs, and practice examples.

*How often should you stop and test what you just learned? 
After every new concept is coded. Redo old HTML/CSS projects where I have wanted to add some JQuery spice

*Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.
Breaks are very impotant I take a 5 min break eery 25 minutes
